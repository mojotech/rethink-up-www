At Rethink Up, our aim is to provide fast, stable, and cost-effective [RethinkDB](http://www.rethinkdb.com "RethinkDB") hosting.

+ **Save Time** - 
  Set up a RethinkDB instance with just a few clicks. Scale up with a few more. Spend more time building awesome products and less time worrying about your data.

+ **Rest Easy** -
  We understand that data integrity is paramount. All paid plans include multi-region replication to provide high availability, as well as daily backups to mitigate the possibility of data loss.

+ **Save Money** -
  Hardware and DBAs cost a lot of money. We're selling peace of mind for a fraction of that cost. Just pay for the space and speed you need and nothing you don't.

Building great products takes time. We're hard at work on our beta release, which will come in the form of a [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com "Heroku") plugin. We expect to ship in the next month. To stay up to date or get early access to the alpha release, please sign up with your email above. Thanks for your support!
